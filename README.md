This is a user script that will issue a 1 day ban on a subreddit for a predetermined reason. Right now, it is tuned to work on /r/AskReddit comment sections, but it could be changed to work reddit wide or subreddit wide by changing "@include". To use this script download [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Greesemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and add as a new Script.
